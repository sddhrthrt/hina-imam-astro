- Open `app.dhub.dev` and log in.
- Click Pull from `main` (Dropdown near the Create pull request button, top right)
- Edit `src/content/posts`. The structure is:

  - `08-post-name/content.mdx` (A folder with `two digit number` + `dash-separated-title`, and `content.mdx` file inside the folder)
  - easiest thing to do would be to make the new folder for a new post in `src/content` and copy-paste a `content.mdx` from a previous post.
- Push to `main`&#x20;

  - Open dropdown near the Create pull request button, top right

  - Select `Push to main`

  - Now the button itself becomes `Push to main`: click it

  - Type a commit message, this is used to keep track of changes. Something basic will do `"new post about xyz"` or `"editing a mistake"`.

  - Hit Push.
- Post should appear in a few minutes.
