- Edit `src/content/posts`. The structure is:
  - `08-post-name/content.mdx` (A folder with `two digit number` + `dash-separated-title`, and `content.mdx` file inside the folder)
  - easiest thing to do would be to make the new folder for a new post in `src/content` and copy-paste a `content.mdx` from a previous post.
- Push to `main`.
- Post should appear in a few minutes.
